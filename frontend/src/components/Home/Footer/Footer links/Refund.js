<p>The information contained in these Conditions and on the website does not comprise an offer of sale, but
an invitation to conclude a transaction. Any contract between you and us for a particular product is only
concluded once your order has been expressly accepted by us. If we do not accept your offer, any amounts
that have been debited from your account will be refunded in full.
To place an order, you must complete the online purchase process. You will find a detailed description of
the purchase process in the Shopping guide. Once you have placed one or several items that you wish to
buy in your shopping basket, you can proceed with your order. Please follow the purchase steps and
complete and check the information required for each step. In addition, during the purchase process you
can change your order and correct any mistakes that have been made before making payment. In the next
step the purchase is processed and payment is taken. The purchase process is concluded by clicking the
button "Pay Now". After this, you receive an email from us in which we confirm receipt of your order
(“order confirmation”). Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted, as your
order only represents an offer to buy one or several products from us. All orders require acceptance on
our part, which is made via an email to you confirming that the order has been dispatched (“dispatch
confirmation”). The contract for the sale of a product (“contract”) is only concluded once we have sent
you the dispatch confirmation.
The contract refers only to those items that are listed in the dispatch confirmation. We are not obliged to
deliver other ordered items until the dispatch of these items has been confirmed in a further dispatch
confirmation.
If you are registered as a user, you can find a list of all your orders under "My Account".</p>
