          This Privacy Policy ( "Policy" ) explains how your personal
          information is collected, used, shared and processed when accessing
          this website or using other services provided by its operator,
          including any written, electronic, and oral communications, online or
          offline, and purchases performed (collectively, the "Services" ) as
          well as the rights and choices you have associated with that
          information. The Services include any services provided via this
          website, located at SHEIN.com (the "Site" ), which includes local
          versions of the Site, such as fr.shein.com or de.shein.com, our mobile
          applications (the "Apps" ), our accounts and fan pages on social media
          platforms (the "Social Media Accounts" ), and any other websites,
          pages, features, or content owned and operated by the Company that
          hyperlink to this Policy. The company selling the products via the
          Site and Apps and providing the Services (and therefore, the payment
          collection entity) is Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd., G01 & 101,
          T/A Grafter Offices, 55 Percy Place, Dublin, 4 D04 E1W7 Ireland,
          acting as a joint controller of the information together with Roadget
          Business Pte. Ltd., 7 Temasek Boulevard, #12 07 Suntec Tower One,
          Singapore (038987). Therefore, the terms “Company”, “we”, “us” or
          “our” refer to Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd. and Roadget
          Business Pte. Ltd. collectively, as joint controllers. Please read our
          this Policy before accessing or using our Services. If you cannot
          agree with this Policy or the Terms and Conditions, please do not
          access or use our Services. The Company is operating the Services and
          the sale of SHEIN brand products, and therefore, is the controller of
          your personal data, and is also responsible for processing and
          protecting your personal data. The joint controllers stated above have
          entered into a joint controller agreement, allocating the essential
          responsibilities as follows: Roadget Business Pte. Ltd. will be
          responsible for operating the Site and providing for its security.
          Infinite Styles Ecommerce Co., Ltd, for the European Union will be
          responsible for using the Site in its respective territory to sell
          products to customers, collecting payment and processing returns. The
          joint controllership agreement is necessary because of the
          aforementioned separation of the technical and commercial levels,
          while at the same time processing your data is necessary for both
          companies, respectively, to provide you with the overall Services
          (consisting of both the sales and the Site and Apps). Right to modify
          this Policy: We may change this Policy from time to time, to reflect
          how we are processing your data, and if we make changes, we will
          notify you by revising the effective date or last modified data at the
          top of this Policy. If we make significant changes that materially
          affect your privacy rights, we will provide advanced notice and make
          that clear on the SHEIN website or other SHEIN services, or by some
          other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review
          the changes before you continue to use the Services. If you do not
          agree with the modified Policy, please discontinue use of the Services
          or do not consent to the updates. Instant information: In addition, we
          may provide you with real time disclosures or additional information
          about the personal information handling practices of specific parts of
          our Services. Such notices may supplement this Policy or provide you
          with additional choices about how we process your personal
          information.
