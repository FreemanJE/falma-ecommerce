        <h2 className="terms">A. 5. EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.</h2>
        <p className="description">
          We will not be liable for any non-compliance or delay in compliance
          with any of the obligations we assume under the EU Terms of Use or
          other contracts when caused by events that are beyond our reasonable
          control ( "Force Majeure" ). Force Majeure shall include any act,
          event, failure to exercise, omission or accident that is beyond our
          reasonable control, including, among others, the following: Strike,
          lockout or other forms of protest. Civil unrest, revolt, invasion,
          terrorist attack or terrorist threat, war (declared or not) or threat
          or preparation for war. Fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake,
          collapse, epidemic or any other natural disaster. Inability to use
          trains, ships, aircraft, motorized transport or other means of
          transport, public or private. Inability to use public or private
          telecommunication systems. Acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or
          restrictions of any government or public authority. Strike, failure or
          accident in maritime or river transport, postal transport or any other
          type of transport. It shall be understood that our obligations
          deriving from the EU Terms of Use or other contracts are suspended
          during the period in which Force Majeure remains in effect and we will
          be given an extension of the period in which to fulfil these
          obligations by an amount of time equal to the time that the situation
          of Force Majeure lasted. We will provide all reasonable resources to
          end the situation of Force Majeure or to find a solution that enables
          us to fulfil our obligations by virtue of the EU Terms of Use or other
          contracts despite the situation of Force Majeure.

        <h2 className="terms">A. 6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h2>
        <p className="description">
          (1) Your claims for damages are excluded, except for such claims for
          damages arising from injury to life, body, health or from the breach
          of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) and except
          for liability for other damages based on an intentional or grossly
          negligent breach of duty by the Company, its legal representatives,
          employees or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are
          those whose fulfillment is necessary to achieve the goal of the
          contract. (2) In the event of a breach of material contractual
          obligations, the Company shall only be liable for the foreseeable
          damage typical for the type of contract if such damage was caused by
          simple negligence, unless the damage claims are based on injury to
          life, body or health. (3) The limitations of liability shall also
          apply in favor of the legal representatives, employees and vicarious
          agents of the Company if claims are asserted directly against them.
          (4) Any applicable mandatory statutory provisions remain unaffected

          on the Site or Apps, shall constitute the entire and only agreement
          between you and us concerning the use of the website or app and

          regarding the subject matter. (2) Any terms and conditions which you
          include in any purchase order, confirmation of order or other document
          are expressly excluded. (3) If any provision of the EU Terms of Use is
          found to be unenforceable, then that provision shall not affect the
          validity of the remaining provisions of the EU Terms of Use, which
          shall remain in full force and effect. (4) No waiver of any term of
          the EU Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
          such term or any other term. Our failure to assert any right or
          provision under the EU Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of
          such right or provision.

          us in that matter, and if required, you will allow us to participate
          in the defense and will not settle any such claim without our prior
          written consent.

        <p className="description">
          (1) These EU Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance

          country of residence. (2) We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive
          jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland, which means that you may bring
